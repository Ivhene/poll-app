# Problems
I did not have any installation problems here. I have a lot of previous front-end experience, so I decided to install React with typescript and Tailwind CSS, as that is (close to) what I had already done in the past.

# Pending issues
I should start this up with saying I was sick for 3 days this week, so I didnt have as much time to work with this as I wanted. I have created a SPA that has the wanted functionality, but there is a lot of bugs and features that makes sence to have that are missing. For example, the application requires a user. The user is stored as a state in the application. There is no way to login to a user, only create one. Therefore, if I refresh the page, the client is logged out. I can then create a new user, which wipes the polls and votes that user already had. There is no editing polls, users or votes, only POST. With more time I would have made sure my application used all the requests I made in the last assignment in order to have full functionality, but I just decided I should just focus on making the basics work, rather than trying to catch up on 3 days of lost work.
